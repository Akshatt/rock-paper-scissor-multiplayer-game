# Rock-Paper-Scissor-multiplayer-game
My attempt to recreate the rock-paper-scissor game using Python.

## Working  
1. Running Server.py initializes the server on which the game is hosted.  
2. Next, for n number of clients, run the Client.py n times.   
3. The code will automatically pair players and if that is not possible then it will tell the remaining player to wait for a new player.   
4. It also takes care of tie-games.
